<h2>Things should be aware of</h2>
<p align="justify"> When you apply for a loan, you cannot repay in EMIs even when you're cash-strapped. During the scenario and when you become a defaulter in the banks' eyes who loaned you money when you default on a personal loan or some other loan on which you cannot repay the whole term, you should take out a gold loan to pay off the outstanding debt.</p>

<h2>The procedure of loan</h2> 

<p align="justify"> The process of the gold loan is held in a managed way as compared to other loans. Gold loan apply online is the fastest way to borrow a loan, and you can use the money for other loans. It is one of the easiest methods and needs only 18 years of age to avail of a gold loan.

<h2>Gold loan interest rate</h2>
<p align="justify">Before deciding about a 'Gold loan' online, you need to compare the interest rate of the gold along with the process and eligibility. When compared to other loans, the gold loan has a much lower interest rate. When we evaluate the interest rates offered by NBFCs, they can make you feel pressured. The public sector bank would request less capital, and their procedures are designed for regular citizens. While the private sector will differ, it will include more of the low-interest rates.</p>

The gold loan does not necessitate a high CIBIL ranking. If you already owe money on a debt and wish to get a gold loan, you should do so. If you fail to repay the loan, the ornaments may be auctioned off, and you will risk your ornaments. That is the key reason you would have to repay interest on the amount. HDFC gold loan would provide you with the highest gold loan rates. If you are in financial difficulty or debt, a gold loan would be precious. The funds will assist you in repaying the full value of the default. The registration fee will be lower, and you will be able to complete all of your tasks at a reasonable cost. The current exchange cost of gold will determine the value of gold. Non-banking financial companies or banks would not allow the diamonds, crystals, or other thighs inserted when you deposit the loan, and then banks will not receive the ornaments received.</p>


<h2>Foreclosure charges</h2> 
It's the best option if you repay the entire amount before the end of the tenure. If the tenure is long, you can shut the loan before the time as per the situation you are having in support of funds. 

<h2>Repayment tenures</h2> 
The gold loan benefit is that it has an easy repayment procedure from 6 to 36 months, and you can return the amount as per the plan. 

<h2>Types of different loan repayment schemes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You have an option to choose the amount earlier to repay and the principal amount later.</li> 
<li>In the bullet repayment method, you have an alternative to paying the amount after one year. </li>
<li>An individual has an option to repay the amount through EMIs. </li>
</ul>


<b>Conclusion:</b> Finally, as the gold loan provides the lowest interest rate, you have a better alternative to choosing this than other loans that offer the highest interest rate.
